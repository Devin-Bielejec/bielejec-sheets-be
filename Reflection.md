-Don't like clicking all the different options for the app
-diagrams are different sizes and often too big
-If I have multiple versions, I want to be able to print them better
-pictures are too small for viewing questions
-Preview part eh
-already created and scaffolded worksheets

Solutions:
-pictures are too small for viewing
-I've tried changin gthe side to 1/2 a page for creating snippets instead of a full page - I also added the directions to the questions that don't have specific questions etc
-diagrams too smalls on worksheet
-updated size to be much smaller and more preferable for worksheet size

-don't like clicking all the options for the app
-switch to generating pictures for the different options and consolidating certain options that don't really matter like rounding between (tenth and hundredth etc)

    -rounding kwargs should be inTermsOfPi = bool
    -this also reduces the amount of code for tool tips etc

    -front end will pull questions for questionKwargs and display each one?

    -for front end picture - add answer to picture, self.previewPicture

    -I'm thinking that boolean values are fine for questions like "picture", "diagram labeled" but mostly useless things I don't want to have to check and just want random

    -I could pass in rounding as a parameter to the class but not include it within kwargs, so that I can declare directions with a rounding string and pass the rounding into each successive class

-Try not resetting state on cha

7/6
-diagrams numbers labeled are funky on some

7/9

Better:
-a lot nicer seeing questions rather than clicking checkboxes

Annoying:
-question images bleeding outside box
-with more questions annoying to scrolls (pagination/filter)
-Overall look is ugly
-preview seems a bit useless sometimes - maybe make it just like the document somehow??
